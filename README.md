# Vancouver Coastal Health Inspection Reports

Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) releases inspection reports for regulated facilities to the public in their [Inspection Reports Website](https://inspections.vch.ca).

The facilities that are listed in the website are:

- Child Care
- Food Premises
- Pools
- Personal Services

In this repository, I will be exploring the Food Premises category within Vancouver.

## Motivation

It would not surprise those who know me that I am analyzing food service inspection reports. I am quite keen of food safety, hygeine, and sanitation.

Don't get me wrong, I am willing to share a meal form a shack on the side of a dirt road. However, if I am in the city buying my work lunch... I rather go to a place minimal critical infractions.

## Inspection Reports

VCH aims to perform an unannounced, pre-planned, inspection on all facilities at least once per year. However, the inspections are performed according to "relative risk" and according to the resources available to Health Protection.

The reports that are made available on the Inspection Report Website are only from routine or routine follow-up inspection related to the current owner. If the food premise has changed ownership, the inspections from the previous owner will not be listed.

The data included in the report will span these four categories:

- IC In compliance
- NIC Not in compliance
- NM Standards not met
- N/A Not applicable
